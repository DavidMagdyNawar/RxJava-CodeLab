# RxJava Basics Codelab

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jraska/RxJava-Codelab.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jraska/RxJava-Codelab)

## Introduction
Reactive programming is mentioned everywhere these days. It solves many common issues of imperative programming
in an elegant way and dozens of libraries give developers powerful tools to make their everyday life easier.
However, it takes time to learn how to wield these tools as they are often difficult to understand
and they can cause more harm than good if used improperly.

We will go through common basics of these tools with the RxJava in use
to demonstrate and get used to main thoughts of the ReactiveX standard.
We will dive into the waters of its beauty with our mindset switched
 to reactive and as we explore, the key ideas will became clear to
 us. These ideas will keep us greedy to learn more, as there is huge world to conquer.
